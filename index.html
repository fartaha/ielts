<li><strong>How long have you lived in your home?</strong>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been living in my current home for about five years now. I moved in back in 2018.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do you like your home? Why?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely, I really like my home. It’s cozy, and I’ve made it my own with personal touches. The location is great too, it’s close to my workplace and all the amenities I need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do all ages live in your area?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, my neighborhood is quite diverse in terms of age groups. There are families with young children, working professionals, and even retirees. It’s a nice mix <strong>I would say</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What kind of music do you like?</strong>
<ul>
<li>I’m a big fan of indie rock and alternative music. I love discovering new bands and enjoying the unique sound they bring. It just resonates with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is there music you don’t like?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Well, I’m not really into heavy metal or hardcore rap. They’re just not my cup of tea. But hey, to each their own, right?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>to each their own: used to say that everyone likes different things: You actually like modern jazz, do you? <strong>Each to their own.</strong> I try not to judge people who like different things from me - <strong>each to their own.</strong> I’m not personally a fan of model trains, but <strong>each to their own.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Do all your friends like music?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of my friends are into music, but everyone has their own preferences. Some are really passionate about it, while others just enjoy it casually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When you were a kid, what would you like to do?</strong>
<ul>
<li>When I was a kid, I used to love spending time outdoors, exploring the woods near my house. I would also spend hours drawing and making up stories. It was a simple but imaginative time.</li>
